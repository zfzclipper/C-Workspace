*Tail Recursion
(1)The use of ONLY ONE recursive call at the VERY END of a function implementation.
	(a)When the function call is made, there are NO statements left to be executed by the function;
	(b)The recursive call is not only the last statement, but there are NO earlier recursive calls, direct or indirect;
(2)Tail recursion could be replaced by one loop.

*Sorting
(1)It is often necessary to sort data before processing.
(2)The first step is to choose the criteria that will be used to order data.


Divide-and-Conquer Approach:
(1)Divide: Break the problem into several subproblems that are similar to the original problem but smaller in size;
(2)Conquer: Solve the subproblems recursively;
(3)Combine: Combine these solutions to create a solution to the original problem;

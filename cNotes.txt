stream
(1)ANY source of input or destination of output.
(2)Represent files stored on various media, or associated with devices that don't store files.

file pointer
(1)Type: FILE*, declared in <stdio,h>.
(2)Used to access a stream in C program.
(3)Three standard streams (FILE*):
   [1]stdin, keyboard(default), input redirection <
   [2]stdout, screen(default), output redirection > 
   [3]stderr, screen(default), output redirection >
(4)Writing error messages to "stderr" instead of "stdout", guarantees that those error messages appear on screen even when stdout is redirected.

text file vs. binary file
(1)bytes in text file represents characters; 
   bytes in binary file doesn't necessary represent characters (e.g. groups of bytes may represent other data types like integers)
(2)text files are divided into lines; each line ends with one or two special characters.
   text files may contain a special "end-of-file" marker.
(3)binary files aren't divided into lines; there are no end-of-line or end-of-file markers; all bytes are treated equally.

Open a file
(1)FILE* fopen(const char* restrict filename, const char* restrict mode);
(2)a null pointer is returned when fopen cannot open a file.
(3)Mode string specifies:
   [1]Operations(read/write/append) to be performed;
   [2]file format(text/binary);
(4)Switch between read and write operations:
   [1]read ----> write: call file-positioning function, or reading reaches the end of file.
   [2]write ----> read: call fflush, or file-positioning function.

Close a file
(1)int fclose(FILE* stream);
(2)Returns 0 if file is closed successfully. Otherwise, returns the error code EOF (i.e. a macro defined in <stdio.h>).

Append a file
(1)FILE* freopen(const char* filename, const char* mode, FILE* stream);
(2)Attach a different file to a stream that is already open. To associate a file with one of standard streams(stdin, stdout, or stderr).

Temporary File
(1)FILE* tmpfile(void);
   [1]Creates a temporary file (opened in "wb+" mode) that will exist until it's closed or program ends.
   [2]Returns a file pointer.
   [3]Two limitations:
	- The name of the file created by tmpfile is "unknown";
	- Cannot make the file permanent later.
(2)char* tmpnam(char* filename);
	L_tmpnam: macro defined in <stdio.h>, specifies the size of character array.
	TMP_MAX: macro defined in <stdio.h>, specifies the maximum number of temporary file names that can potentially be generated.

File Buffering
(1)Idea: 
	Disk dirve is slow, infeasible for program to access disk file directly.
	Data written to a stream is stored in a buffer area in memory, when it's full or the stream is closed, the buffer is flushed.
	Input stream is buffered in similar way: the buffer contains data from input device. Program reads input from buffer rather than device,
(2)int fflush(FILE* stream);	
   [1]Flush the buffer of file associated with the file pointer FILE*, flush all output streams when NULL;
   [2]Returns 0 when successful, EOF when error occurs.
(3)int setvbuf(FILE * stream, char * buf, int mode, size_t size);

File operations working with filenames
(1)int remove(const char* filename);
(2)int rename(const char* old, const char* new);
